# Seraphim
> A Firefox fork focused on security and privacy

Seraphim began as my project for [CS/ECE/PUBP 6727 - Cyber Security Practicum](https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/cybersecurity-ms/#requirementstext), the capstone course for the Georgia Institute of Technology's Master of Science in Cybersecurity [program](https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/cybersecurity-ms/). The idea was that it would be another flavor of privacy-focused forks in the same vein as LibreWolf and others.

## üìã Goals

- Disabling telemetry and additional components of Firefox that conflict with user privacy
- Replace some aspects of Firefox's features or user interface with open-source alternatives (e.g. uBlock origin)
- Implement enhanced performance over native Firefox thanks to optimization improvements and configuration changes
